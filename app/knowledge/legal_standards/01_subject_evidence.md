# Subject Qualification, Evidence Burden, and Statute of Limitations Standards
# 主体资格、举证责任与时效标准

## Purpose

This reference provides detailed legal standards for reviewing creditor qualifications, allocating burden of proof, and determining various limitation periods in bankruptcy debt claims. These are foundational issues that must be addressed before substantive debt review.

## Part 1: Subject Qualification Review / 主体资格审查

### 1.1 Basic Principle

The creditor declaring debt to the administrator must be **the same entity** as the rights holder when the underlying legal facts occurred. If changes occurred, the applicant must provide evidence proving identity continuity.

### 1.2 Common Subject Change Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Debt Assignment (债权转让)

**Requirements**:
- Debt assignment agreement
- Original creditor-debtor relationship证明
- Notice to debtor (per Civil Code Article 546)
- Assignee's subject qualification documents

**Review Points**:
- Assignment validity (whether restricted by contract, law, or nature)
- Whether debtor was properly notified
- If assignment happened after bankruptcy filing, review in light of Bankruptcy Law Article 20

#### Scenario 2: Original Creditor Name Change (债权人名称变更)

**Requirements**:
- Industrial and commercial registration showing name change
- Continuity of registered entity number/unified social credit code
- Explicit statement of name change, not enterprise split/merger

#### Scenario 3: Enterprise Restructuring (企业改制)

**Requirements**:
- Restructuring approval documents
- Asset/liability inheritance agreements
- Industrial and commercial registration showing succession relationship

#### Scenario 4: Corporate Split (公司分立)

**Requirements**:
- Split resolution and agreement
- Creditor notification证明 or announcement证明
- Per Civil Code Article 174: Unless otherwise agreed with creditors at the time of split, split entities bear joint and several liability

#### Scenario 5: Corporate Merger (公司合并)

**Requirements**:
- Merger agreement
- Creditor notification/announcement证明
- Per Civil Code Article 173: Merger surviving entity or newly formed entity inherits debts

### 1.3 Duplicate Declaration Handling

**Principle**: When both original and new creditors declare the same debt, **prioritize the new creditor's declaration**.

**Process**:
1. Confirm validity of subject change
2. Notify both parties of the duplicate
3. Confirm the legitimately changed creditor only
4. Reject the original creditor's declaration

---

## Part 2: Burden of Proof / 举证责任

### 2.1 Core Principle

**Creditors bear complete burden of proof** for their claims and are responsible for authenticity, legality, and relevance of evidence.

**Legal Basis**: Bankruptcy Law Article 48 - creditors shall declare claims; administrator reviews and determines.

### 2.2 Three-Tier Evidence Review Standard

#### Tier 1: Sufficient Evidence (充分举证)

**Creditor provides complete evidence chain**:
- Underlying contractual relationship证明 (contract, purchase order, etc.)
- Performance证明 (delivery notes, acceptance records, receipts)
- Payment deficit证明 (accounting records, reconciliation statements, dunning letters)

**Administrator Action**: Confirm debt

#### Tier 2: Insufficient Evidence + Financial Records Present (举证不足+财务记载)

**Situation**:
- Creditor's evidence insufficient to support claim
- Creditor fails to supplement within deadline
- **BUT** debtor's financial records show the debt
- **AND** business department confirms transaction authenticity

**Example**:
Procurement debt where creditor provides only contract OR only invoice OR only bid notice, but:
- Business department confirms goods received and procurement occurred
- Finance department confirms non-payment

**Administrator Action**: Confirm debt based on comprehensive evidence

**Rationale**: Balance creditor protection with evidence reality; prevent unjust enrichment by debtor

#### Tier 3: Insufficient Evidence + No Financial Records (举证不足+无财务记载)

**Situation**:
- Creditor's evidence insufficient
- Fails to supplement within deadline
- No records in debtor's financial documents

**Administrator Action**: Do not confirm

**Post-Remedy**: If creditor supplements evidence during objection period or other adjustable periods per law, adjust accordingly

### 2.3 Debtor's Feedback Role

**Standard Process**:
- Debtor should provide feedback opinions as reference for debt review
- If debtor objectively cannot provide feedback, fails to provide evidence, or financial records unclear:
  - Administrator may review based on creditor's materials
  - Materials obtained by administrator through legal means
  - Other available information

**Result**: Debtor's non-response does not automatically confirm or deny debt; administrator exercises independent judgment

### 2.4 Third-Party Verification

**When Required**: Debt involves other debtors (primary debtor, guarantors) or third-party payers

**Process**:
1. Administrator actively sends verification letters requesting reply
2. If related parties do not respond or provide evidence:
   - Administrator may review based on creditor's materials
   - And materials lawfully obtained by administrator
   - **If insufficient to confirm, generally do not confirm**

**Principle**: Third-party silence does not equal confirmation; confirmation requires meeting substantive conditions

---

## Part 3: Scope of Bankruptcy Claims / 债权基本范围

### 3.1 Definition of Bankruptcy Claims

**Bankruptcy Law Provisions**:

#### Article 44
Creditors holding claims against debtor **at the time of bankruptcy filing** exercise rights per this Law's procedures.

#### Article 46
- **Unmatured claims**: Deemed matured at bankruptcy filing
- **Interest-bearing claims**: Stop accruing interest from bankruptcy filing date

#### Article 47
Creditors may declare:
- Conditional claims
- Claims with time limits
- Claims in pending litigation or arbitration

### 3.2 Special Claim Treatments

**Unmatured Claims**:
- Calculate as if matured on bankruptcy filing date
- No discount for early maturity
- Interest stops at bankruptcy filing date (more precisely, day before filing)

**Conditional/Time-Limited Claims**:
- May declare at current status
- Administrator provisionally confirms
- Final confirmation upon condition fulfillment or time arrival

**Pending Litigation/Arbitration Claims**:
- May declare provisionally
- Administrator suspends final determination
- Confirm per effective judgment/award after proceedings conclude

---

## Part 4: Non-Bankruptcy Claims / 不属于破产债权

Per Bankruptcy Law and judicial interpretations, the following are **not bankruptcy claims**:

### 4.1 Post-Filing Interest (破产受理后的债务利息)

**Rule**: Interest ceases accruing from bankruptcy filing date (Bankruptcy Law Article 46)

**Application**:
- For interest-bearing debts, calculate interest only until day before bankruptcy filing
- Any interest accrued after bankruptcy filing is not a bankruptcy claim
- Cannot be declared or confirmed

**Exception**: Secured claims may receive interest from secured property proceeds (if sufficient余值after principal)

### 4.2 Statute-Barred Claims (超过诉讼时效或申请执行期间的债权)

**Two Types**:

**(1) Claims Exceeding Statute of Limitations**:
- No evidence of tolling, suspension, or extension
- Administrator does not confirm

**(2) Claims Exceeding Execution Period**:
- Creditor obtained effective legal instrument
- Failed to apply for execution within statutory period (generally 2 years)
- Administrator does not confirm

**Critical**: Reviewed in detail in Part 5 below

### 4.3 Creditor's Participation Costs (债权人参加破产程序支出的费用)

**Rule**: Creditor's own costs for participating in bankruptcy proceedings (travel, accommodation, own attorney fees not awarded by court, etc.) are not bankruptcy claims

**Reason**: These are creditor's own expenses for exercising rights, not debts owed by debtor

**Exception**: Court-awarded litigation costs/attorney fees (if meeting conditions) may be bankruptcy claims

### 4.4 Shareholder/Stockholder Rights (股权、股票上的权利)

**Rule**: Equity interests in debtor entity are not creditor's rights

**Application**:
- Shareholders cannot declare dividend claims
- Stock value decline is not a bankruptcy claim
- Equity interests are adjusted per bankruptcy procedure (liquidation or reorganization)

### 4.5 Other Statutory Non-Claims

Per other laws, administrative regulations, and judicial interpretations.

## Part 5: Limitation Periods / 诉讼时效/执行时效/除斥期间

This is one of the most critical review points. Limitation period errors can result in improper confirmation of time-barred claims.

### 5.1 Statute of Limitations (诉讼时效)

#### 5.1.1 Basic Rules

**Civil Code Article 188** (effective 2021-01-01):
- General statute: **3 years**
- Commences when rights holder knows or should know of rights infringement and obligor identity
- Absolute limit: 20 years from date of rights infringement (special extension possible upon application)

**Historical Change**:
- Pre-Civil Code (General Principles of Civil Law): 2 years
- Transitional rules apply (see below)

#### 5.1.2 Statute of Limitations Calculation

**Formula**:
```
Statute Period = Claim Declaration Date - Statute Commencement Date
```

**Critical**: Calculate from statute commencement date to **declaration date** (or bankruptcy petition date if petitioner), **NOT to bankruptcy filing date**.

**Example**:
- Contract performance deadline: 2020-01-01
- Bankruptcy filing date: 2024-05-01
- Creditor declaration date: 2024-08-01
- Statute period: 2024-08-01 minus 2020-01-01 = 4 years 7 months
- Result: **Exceeds 3-year statute** (if no interruption/suspension) → Do not confirm

#### 5.1.3 Statute Commencement

**General Rule**: Day when rights holder knows or should know:
1. Rights were infringed (debt not paid)
2. Obligor identity (who owes the debt)

**Common Scenarios**:

**(1) Specified Performance Deadline**:
- Statute commences day after performance deadline
- Example: Deadline 2020-12-31 → Statute begins 2021-01-01

**(2) No Performance Deadline Specified**:
- Creditor demands performance, giving debtor reasonable grace period
- Statute commences when grace period expires
- If no demand made, statute may not have commenced

**(3) Installment Debts** (Civil Code Article 189):
- Statute commences from last installment's due date
- Not from each installment separately

**(4) Simple Account Receivables Without Agreement**:
- No evidence of repayment agreement, dunning, or litigation
- May be treated as statute not yet commenced prior to declaration

#### 5.1.4 Statute Interruption (诉讼时效中断)

**Civil Code Article 195** - Statute interrupts and restarts upon:

1. **Rights holder demands performance from obligor**
2. **Obligor agrees to perform**
3. **Rights holder files lawsuit or arbitration**
4. **Other circumstances with equivalent effect**

**Evidence Forms**:
- (1) Demand letters with proof of service
- (2) Debtor's written acknowledgment (letters, meeting minutes, email confirmation)
- (3) Chat records acknowledged by debtor in writing
- (4) Debtor manager's written confirmation (supplementary only; not sufficient as sole evidence)
- (5) Litigation/arbitration filing documents
- (6) Other

**After Interruption**: Statute period restarts from interruption date

**Creditor Duty**: If claiming interruption, must provide proof. Absence of proof = statute not interrupted

#### 5.1.5 Partial Repayment After Statute Expiration

**Rule**: If statute expired, debtor's partial repayment produces interruption effect **only for the repaid portion**, not for the entire debt.

**Example**:
- Original debt: 1,000,000
- Statute expired in 2021
- Debtor repaid 100,000 in 2022
- Result: 100,000 has new statute period starting 2022; 900,000 remains time-barred

### 5.2 Transitional Application of Old and New Statute Rules

**Civil Law General Principles** (pre-2021-01-01): 2-year statute

**Civil Code** (2021-01-01 onward): 3-year statute

**Transition Rules** (Per Supreme Court Interpretation on Civil Code Time Effectiveness):

**(1) Statute period commenced after 2017-10-01** (General Principles of Civil Law effective date):
- Apply Civil Code 3-year rule

**(2) Statute period commenced before 2017-10-01, but 2-year period not yet expired by 2017-10-01**:
- Apply Civil Code 3-year rule from commencement date

**(3) Statute period commenced before 2017-10-01, and 2-year period already expired by 2017-10-01**:
- Cannot apply Civil Code 3-year rule
- Claim is time-barred

**In Practice**: Most current bankruptcy filings (2024-2025) will apply 3-year statute

### 5.3 Execution Period (申请执行期间)

#### 5.3.1 Basic Rule

**Execution Period**: 2 years to apply for enforcement of effective legal instruments

**Civil Procedure Law Article 246**:
- Period for applying to enforce effective legal instrument: 2 years
- Commences from last day of performance period specified in instrument
- If no performance period specified: from effective date of instrument

#### 5.3.2 Calculation Method

**Formula**:
```
Execution Period = Declaration Date - Execution Period Commencement Date
```

**Commencement Date**:
- Last day of履行period specified in judgment/award → Next day
- If instrument says "perform within X days of effectiveness": effectiveness date + X days → next day
- If no period specified: effectiveness date → next day

**Example**:
- Judgment dated 2020-01-01, effective 2020-01-17 (after 15-day appeal period)
- Judgment requires: "Pay within 10 days of effectiveness"
- Execution period starts: 2020-01-17 + 10 days = 2020-01-27 → next day = 2020-01-28
- Creditor declares 2024-02-01
- Execution period: 2024-02-01 minus 2020-01-28 = Over 3 years
- Result: **Exceeds 2-year execution period** → Require execution documents, otherwise do not confirm

#### 5.3.3 Tolling and Suspension of Execution Period

**Execution period tolling and suspension apply civil code statute of limitations tolling/suspension rules**.

**Interruption Events** (restarts 2-year period):
- Creditor applies for execution (even if later withdrawn)
- Debtor partially performs
- Debtor acknowledges debt in writing

**Evidence Required**: If creditor claims interruption, must provide evidence (execution application receipt, court execution record, debtor payment record, written acknowledgment, etc.)

#### 5.3.4 Administrator's Duty

**If Creditor Provides Only Judgment/Award**:
- Administrator must verify through phone inquiry, public channels whether further proceedings exist
- Confirm final effective legal instrument

**If Execution Period Appears Exceeded**:
- Require creditor to provide execution documents (execution application, court acceptance notice, execution record, etc.)
- If creditor cannot provide: Do not confirm the claim

**Rationale**: Execution period is a critical procedural deadline; failure to exercise rights within period results in loss of enforcement ability

### 5.4 Exclusion Period (除斥期间)

**Definition**: A fixed, unalterable period for exercising certain rights, not subject to tolling, suspension, or interruption.

**Distinction from Statute of Limitations**:
| Feature | Statute of Limitations | Exclusion Period |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|
| Nature | Procedural defense right | Substantive right existence period |
| Tolling/Suspension/Interruption | Yes | No |
| Effect if Exceeded | Loses right to prevail, but right still exists | Right extinguished |

**Common Exclusion Periods in Bankruptcy**:

**(1) Construction Project Priority Right Exercise Period**:
- **18 months** from date payment should have been made (Civil Code Article 807)
- Per Supreme Court Construction Contract Interpretation (I) Article 41
- Not subject to tolling or interruption
- See `07_special_claims_standards.md` for details

**(2) Guarantee Period** (保证期间):
- Per Civil Code Articles 692-693
- Generally 6 months from primary debt performance deadline (if agreed unclear or not agreed)
- Or 2 years (old Guarantee Law rule for pre-Civil Code guarantees)
- Not subject to tolling or interruption
- See `06_secured_claims_standards.md` for details

**Administrator's Duty**:
- Exclusion periods must be calculated strictly
- Simultaneous check with statute of limitations and execution period
- Note: guarantee period AND execution period AND statute of limitations all apply; check each independently

---

## Part 6: Multi-Period Coordinated Review / 多重期间综合审查

In practice, a single claim may involve multiple limitation periods. Administrator must check all applicable periods.

### 6.1 Comprehensive Review Checklist

For each claim, verify:

```
□ Underlying debt: Statute of limitations (3 years, check for interruption)
□ If guaranteed: Guarantee period (6 months or per agreement, no interruption)
□ If litigated: Execution period (2 years from judgment performance deadline)
□ If priority right: Exclusion period (e.g., 18 months for construction priority)
```

**Result**: Claim must pass ALL applicable period checks to be confirmed

### 6.2 Practical Example - Multi-Period Review

**Case**:
- Contract signed: 2018-01-01
- Payment due: 2019-01-01
- Creditor filed lawsuit: 2020-06-01 (statute interrupted)
- Judgment issued: 2021-03-01, effective 2021-03-17
- Judgment deadline: "Pay within 15 days of effectiveness" → 2021-04-01
- Guarantee signed: 2018-01-01, guarantee period agreed: "until primary debt performance deadline" → 6 months principle applies → 2019-07-01
- Creditor declares: 2024-05-01
- Bankruptcy filed: 2024-05-09

**Analysis**:

**(1) Statute of Limitations** (underlying debt):
- Commenced: 2019-01-02 (day after payment due)
- Interrupted by lawsuit: 2020-06-01
- Restarted: 2020-06-01
- Calculate to declaration: 2024-05-01 minus 2020-06-01 = 3 years 11 months
- **Result**: Exceeded 3-year statute → time-barred

**Conclusion**: Do not confirm debt against primary debtor (statute-barred)

**(2) Guarantee Period**:
- Commenced: 2019-01-02 (day after primary debt deadline)
- Ended: 2019-07-01 (6 months later)
- Creditor sued debtor 2020-06-01 (after guarantee period)
- **Result**: Guarantee period expired, creditor lost right to claim guarantor

**Conclusion**: Do not confirm guarantee debt (guarantee period expired)

**(3) Execution Period** (judgment):
- Judgment performance deadline: 2021-04-01
- Execution period commences: 2021-04-02
- Calculate to declaration: 2024-05-01 minus 2021-04-02 = 3 years 29 days
- **Result**: Exceeded 2-year execution period

**Conclusion**: Do not confirm judgment debt either (execution period expired)

**Final Result**: This claim cannot be confirmed under any theory (primary debt statute-barred, guarantee period expired, execution period expired)

**Key Takeaway**: Even with litigation and judgment, creditor can still lose rights through execution period expiration. Every period must be checked.

## Part 7: Evidence Classification and Hierarchy / 证据分类与层级

### 7.1 Evidence Classification by Source

**(1) Legal Instruments** (最高证明力):
- Effective judgments, rulings, mediation agreements
- Arbitration awards
- Notarized creditor's rights documents

**(2) Bilateral Confirmation Documents**:
- Contracts signed by both parties
- Reconciliation statements signed by both parties
- Settlement agreements

**(3) Unilateral Evidence**:
- Invoices, delivery notes, receipts (created by one party)
- Internal documents
- Witness testimony

**(4) Debtor's Financial Records**:
- Accounting vouchers, ledgers
- Financial statements

### 7.2 Evidence Hierarchy Application

**Principle**: Higher-tier evidence prevails when conflict exists

**Priority Order**:
1. Effective legal instruments (court/arbitration)
2. Bilateral written confirmations
3. Debtor's financial records + business department confirmation
4. Unilateral evidence (weaker, may be insufficient alone)

**Administrator Review**:
- Assess authenticity (not forged or altered)
- Assess legality (obtained through legal means, not violating mandatory rules)
- Assess relevance (directly proves the claim)

### 7.3 Special Evidence Considerations

**Electronic Evidence** (emails, WeChat/WhatsApp messages):
- Increasingly accepted, but authentication required
- Best if acknowledged by debtor in writing
- Should have original electronic data preservation

**Testimonies**:
- Witness testimony alone generally insufficient
- Must be corroborated by documentary evidence
- Debtor manager's confirmation useful but not determinative alone

---

## Summary / 总结

Subject qualification, burden of proof, and limitation periods are **gateway issues** in debt review:

**Subject Qualification**:
- Identity continuity must be proven
- Priority given to legitimately changed creditor
- Documentary evidence of change required

**Burden of Proof**:
- Creditor bears complete burden
- Three tiers: sufficient evidence, insufficient + financial records, insufficient + no records
- Administrator exercises independent judgment

**Limitation Periods** - **Most Critical**:
- **Statute of Limitations**: 3 years (interruptible)
- **Execution Period**: 2 years (interruptible)
- **Guarantee Period**: 6 months/2 years/per agreement (not interruptible)
- **Exclusion Periods**: e.g., 18 months for construction priority (not interruptible)
- **Calculate to declaration date, NOT bankruptcy filing date**
- **All applicable periods must be satisfied**

**Recommendation**: Create limitation period checklist for each claim type and verify methodically. Limitation period errors are among the most common and consequential mistakes in bankruptcy debt review.

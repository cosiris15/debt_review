# Financial Institution Claims Review Standards
# 金融机构债权审查标准

## Purpose

This reference provides detailed standards for reviewing claims from financial institutions, which have special rules regarding interest rates, compound interest, penalty interest, and regulatory compliance that differ from ordinary commercial and private lending claims.

## Part 1: Definition and Identification of Financial Institutions / 金融机构的定义与识别

### 1.1 Broad Definition

**Financial Institution**: Entities operating financial business, including:
- Banks (commercial banks, policy banks, rural credit cooperatives)
- Non-bank financial institutions:
  - Trust investment companies
  - Financial leasing companies
  - Securities companies
  - Insurance companies
  - Finance companies (企业财务公司)
  - Asset management companies
  - Consumer finance companies

### 1.2 Regulatory Licensing

**Critical Identification**: Entity must hold **financial business license** issued by financial regulatory authorities

**Regulatory Authorities** ("一行两会" system, historically):
- People's Bank of China (PBOC) - central bank
- China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) - banking and insurance
- China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) - securities

**Also Include**: Small loan companies (小额贷款公司), pawn shops (典当行) licensed by local government financial regulatory departments

### 1.3 Verification Method

**Administrator's Duty**: When creditor claims to be financial institution:
1. Request business license showing financial business scope
2. Request financial license or approval documents from regulatory authority
3. Verify through regulatory authority public inquiry systems (if available)

**If Not Licensed**: Creditor is **not** a financial institution; its lending is **private lending**, subject to private lending rules (see `05_private_lending_standards.md`)

**Critical Distinction**: Financial institution loans do **not** apply Private Lending Judicial Interpretation interest rate caps; they apply financial regulatory rules and reasonableness standards

## Part 2: Documentation Review for Financial Institution Claims / 金融机构债权证据材料审查

### 2.1 Required Documents

**Basic Documents**:
1. **Loan Contract** (or facility agreement, credit agreement)
2. **Guarantee Contracts** (if secured - mortgage, pledge, guarantee)
3. **Loan Vouchers** (借据, IOUs, disbursement records)
4. **Corporate Resolutions** (for credit decision, if applicable to creditor's internal governance)

**Additional for Secured Claims**:
5. **Collateral Registration Certificates** (for mortgages/pledges)
6. **Collateral Appraisal Reports** (if available)
7. **Guarantee Registration / Filing Documents**

### 2.2 Particular Review Points

**Loan Contract**:
- Borrowing parties, principal amount, term, interest rate, purpose
- Guarantee clauses (if any)
- Default provisions
- Interest calculation method (simple, compound, penalty)

**Loan Vouchers** (Critically Important):
- Prove actual disbursement (not just contract signature)
- Typical form: Borrower-signed IOU, bank transfer records
- Match voucher amount with claimed principal

**Guarantee Contracts**:
- Verify guarantor/pledgor/mortgagor authority
- Check registration/perfection for secured interests

## Part 3: Disguised Interest / 变相利息认定

### 3.1 Common Disguised Interest Forms

Financial institutions may charge fees nominally designated as:
- **Service fees** (服务费)
- **Consulting fees** (咨询费)
- **Advisory fees** (顾问费)
- **Management fees** (管理费)
- **Investigation fees** (调查费)
- **Commitment fees** (承诺费)

### 3.2 Legal Standard

**Per Judicial Interpretation and Precedent**: If these fees are:
- **Unreasonable** in amount, OR
- **Not supported by actual services rendered**, OR
- **Collected by financial institution or its designated party**

→ They may be determined as **disguised interest** and should be included in total interest calculation for cap review

### 3.3 Administrator Review Approach

**Burden**: Financial institution (creditor) should prove fees are reasonable and supported by actual services

**Administrator Actions**:
1. **Request evidence** of services actually provided (service contracts, invoices, work product)
2. **Assess reasonableness** considering industry standards and actual work performed
3. **Determine**:
   - If reasonable and supported: Treat as separate legitimate fees (ordinary claim if not secured)
   - If unreasonable or unsupported: **Treat as disguised interest**, add to interest calculation, check against caps

**Example**:
- Loan: 10,000,000 yuan, 1-year term, 6% interest
- "Consulting fee": 500,000 yuan (5% of principal)
- Bank cannot show what consulting service was provided
- **Determination**: 500,000 is disguised interest
- Effective interest rate: 6% + 5% = 11% (evaluate against reasonableness standards)

---

## Part 4: Interest Rate Review for Financial Institutions / 金融机构利率审查

### 4.1 General Principle

**Financial institution loan contracts**: Interest rate is generally enforced as agreed, subject to reasonableness review

**Not Subject to**: Private Lending Judicial Interpretation rate caps (24% pre-2020, LPR×4 post-2020)

**But Subject to**: Supreme Court guidance on financial reasonableness (see below)

### 4.2 Supreme Court Guidance on Financial Lending

**"Several Opinions on Further Strengthening Financial Trial Work"** (关于进一步加强金融审判工作的若干意见) Article 2:

> "Strictly regulate high-interest lending and effectively reduce real economy financing costs. For financial loan contracts where borrower claims interest, compound interest, penalty interest, liquidated damages, and other fees are excessive and significantly deviate from actual losses, and requests reduction of amounts exceeding annual rate of 24%, courts should support, to effectively reduce real economy financing costs."

**Key Points**:
- Financial institution can charge higher than private lending caps
- **But**: Total of all charges (interest + compound interest + penalty + fees) should not **significantly exceed 24% annually** if borrower objects
- This is a reasonableness standard, not an absolute cap
- Applies when borrower raises objection; otherwise enforceable as agreed

### 4.3 Application in Bankruptcy

**Creditor Declares Interest**:
- Review total effective rate (including all interest, compound interest, penalty, fees)
- If total **significantly exceeds** 24% annually: May reduce to reasonable level (around 24%)
- If within reasonable range or close to 24%: Confirm as declared

**Exception**: If rate already confirmed by effective court judgment, generally no need to reduce further (judgment is binding)

**"Significantly Exceeds"**: Typically interpreted as materially higher than 24% (e.g., 30%+), not slightly over (e.g., 25-26%)

---

## Part 5: Compound Interest (复利) - Financial Institution Special Rules

### 5.1 Legal Basis for Financial Compound Interest

**Unlike private lending**, financial institutions may charge compound interest per:
- **"RMB Interest Rate Management Rules"** (人民币利率管理规定) issued by People's Bank of China
- **"PBOC Notice on RMB Loan Interest Rate Issues"** (中国人民银行关于人民币贷款利率有关问题的通知)

### 5.2 Nature of Financial Compound Interest

**Key Distinction**: Financial "compound interest" (复利) ≠ interest on principal + interest

**Correct Understanding**:
- Financial compound interest applies **only to unpaid interest**, not to unpaid principal
- It is "interest on overdue interest", not "principal + interest → new principal → interest"

**Base**: Unpaid interest only (利息, not including principal本金)

### 5.3 Two Types of Financial Compound Interest

#### Type 1: Compound Interest During Loan Term (贷款期内复利)

**Scenario**: Borrower fails to pay **interest** by scheduled payment date during loan term

**Calculation**:
- Base: Unpaid interest amount
- Rate: **Loan contract rate** (same as original loan rate)
- Period: From interest due date to actual payment (or to bankruptcy filing date - 1 day)

**Example**:
- Loan: 1,000,000 yuan, annual rate 6%, term 3 years
- Year 1 interest due (60,000) not paid by borrower
- Year 1 interest becomes overdue
- Compound interest on Year 1 interest: 60,000 × 6% × [days overdue] / 360

#### Type 2: Compound Interest After Loan Overdue or Misappropriation (逾期或挤占挪用后复利)

**Scenario**: Loan becomes overdue (principal not repaid) or is misappropriated, AND borrower also fails to pay **interest**

**Calculation**:
- Base: Unpaid interest amount
- Rate: **Penalty interest rate** (not loan rate; typically loan rate × 1.3-1.5 for overdue)
- Period: From interest overdue date to bankruptcy filing date - 1 day

**Example**:
- Loan overdue; original rate 6%, penalty rate 6% × 1.5 = 9%
- Interest due during overdue period: 100,000 yuan (itself calculated at 9%)
- This 100,000 interest not paid
- Compound interest on this overdue interest: 100,000 × 9% × [days] / 360

### 5.4 Compound Interest Review Points

**Administrator Actions**:
1. **Verify contractual basis** for compound interest (must be in loan contract)
2. **Verify calculation base**: Should be unpaid **interest only**, not include principal
3. **Verify calculation rate**: Loan rate (Type 1) or penalty rate (Type 2)
4. **Check total burden**: Total interest + compound interest + penalty should not significantly exceed 24% annually (reasonableness check)

**Common Error**: Creditor includes principal in compound interest base → Reject; only unpaid interest can be compounded

---

## Part 6: Penalty Interest (罚息) - Financial Institution Rules

### 6.1 Legal Basis

**"RMB Interest Rate Management Rules"** and **"PBOC Notice on RMB Loan Interest Rate Issues"**: Financial institutions charge penalty interest (罚息) in two scenarios

### 6.2 Scenario 1: Overdue Penalty Interest (逾期罚息)

**Situation**: Borrower fails to repay **principal** by due date

**Calculation**:
- Base: **Unpaid principal** (本金)
- Rate: **Loan contract rate × 1.3 to 1.5** (30%-50% markup)
- Period: From day after due date to bankruptcy filing date - 1 day

**Contract Language**: Typically "overdue penalty interest at 150% of contract rate" or "overdue penalty interest at contract rate plus 50%"

**Example**:
- Principal: 5,000,000 yuan
- Due date: 2020-12-31
- Original loan rate: 5%
- Penalty rate: 5% × 1.5 = 7.5%
- Overdue penalty interest: 5,000,000 × 7.5% × [days from 2021-01-01 to 2024-05-08] / 360

### 6.3 Scenario 2: Misappropriation Penalty Interest (挤占挪用罚息)

**Situation**: Borrower uses loan for **unauthorized purposes** (not per loan contract purpose clause)

**Calculation**:
- Base: **Loan principal** (全部本金, even if not yet due)
- Rate: **Loan contract rate × 1.5 to 1.8** (50%-80% markup)
- Period: From misappropriation discovery date (or contract-specified date) to correction date (or bankruptcy filing date - 1 day)

**Example**:
- Loan for equipment purchase, used for real estate speculation
- Principal: 10,000,000 yuan
- Original rate: 5%
- Misappropriation penalty rate: 5% × 1.8 = 9%
- Misappropriation penalty interest: 10,000,000 × 9% × [days] / 360

### 6.4 Prohibition on Stacking Penalties

**Critical Rule**: If loan is both **overdue** AND **misappropriated**:
- Calculate both overdue penalty and misappropriation penalty
- **Apply the higher penalty only** (择其重者)
- **Cannot stack both** (不得并处)

**Reasoning**: Avoid double penalty for same breach period

**Example**:
- Loan overdue: Would incur penalty at 7.5%
- Also misappropriated: Would incur penalty at 9%
- **Apply**: 9% penalty only (the higher)

### 6.5 Penalty Interest Review Checklist

```
□ Contract provides for penalty interest?
□ Penalty rate within regulatory range (1.3-1.8x of original rate)?
□ Overdue vs. misappropriation scenario correctly identified?
□ Calculation base correct (principal only for penalty, not interest)?
□ If both overdue and misappropriation: Applied higher penalty only?
□ Total burden (regular interest + penalty + compound) reasonable?
```

## Part 7: Transfer of Non-Performing Financial Claims / 金融不良债权转让

### 7.1 Definition

**Non-Performing Loan (NPL)**: Loan classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss per banking regulations

**Transfer**: Financial institution (original creditor) transfers NPL to asset management company (AMC) or other investor; transferee becomes new creditor

### 7.2 Legal Framework

**Supreme Court "Minutes of Symposium on NPL Transfer Cases"** (关于审理涉及金融不良债权转让案件工作座谈会纪要) provides guidance on interest calculation post-transfer

### 7.3 Interest Calculation After Transfer

**General Principle**: NPL transfer agreement typically specifies how interest is handled post-transfer

**Three Common Scenarios**:

#### Scenario 1: Agreement Specifies Interest Continues at Original Rate

**Contract Language**: "Transferee succeeds to all rights of original creditor, including continuing to collect interest per original loan contract"

**Application**: Calculate interest at original loan contract rate from transfer date to bankruptcy filing date - 1 day

**Administrator Action**: Confirm interest per original rate

#### Scenario 2: Agreement Specifies Interest Continues at Agreed New Rate

**Contract Language**: "Post-transfer interest accrues at X% annual rate"

**Application**: Calculate at agreed new rate

**Review**: Check if new rate is reasonable (should not create windfall significantly beyond original creditor's rights)

#### Scenario 3: Agreement Silent on Post-Transfer Interest

**Per Supreme Court NPL Transfer Minutes**: Courts may determine interest continues to accrue per original loan contract terms

**Administrator Application**: May calculate at original loan contract rate (absent contrary evidence)

**Alternative**: If transferee does not claim post-transfer interest, confirm only accrued interest through transfer date

### 7.4 Key Verification Points

**Administrator Actions**:
1. **Review transfer agreement**: Understand interest treatment terms
2. **Verify transferee rights**: Ensure transfer was valid and transferee properly notified debtor
3. **Calculate correctly**:
   - Pre-transfer interest: Per original loan contract
   - Post-transfer interest: Per transfer agreement or original contract (if silent)
4. **Check against reasonableness**: Total interest should not exceed reasonable levels

## Part 8: Variable Interest Rates and Rate Adjustments / 浮动利率与利率调整

### 8.1 Floating Rate Loans

**Modern Practice**: Many financial institution loans use floating rates tied to:
- LPR (Loan Prime Rate) - since 2019
- Formerly: PBOC benchmark lending rate

**Contract Language**: "Loan rate = LPR 1-year + X basis points" or "LPR 1-year × Y multiplier"

**Example**:
- Contract: "Loan rate = LPR 1-year + 100 basis points (1%)"
- LPR 1-year on signing: 3.85%
- Initial loan rate: 3.85% + 1% = 4.85%

### 8.2 Rate Adjustment Mechanism

**Typical Terms**:
- Rate adjusts periodically (monthly, quarterly, annually)
- New rate = Current LPR + fixed spread/multiplier
- Takes effect from adjustment date

**Calculation Method**: See `03_interest_calculation_standards.md` Part 5.5 (segmented rate application)

### 8.3 Administrator Review

**Duties**:
1. **Verify adjustment terms in contract**
2. **Obtain LPR historical data** (from PBOC or National Interbank Funding Center website)
3. **Apply segmented calculation** with different rates for different periods
4. **Document rate change dates and sources** in calculation file

---

## Part 9: Total Rate Reasonableness Review / 总利率合理性审查

### 9.1 Cumulative Rate Calculation

**Formula**:
```
Effective Annual Rate = (Regular Interest + Compound Interest + Penalty Interest + Fees) / Principal / Years × 100%
```

### 9.2 Reasonableness Threshold

**Supreme Court Guidance**: Total should not significantly exceed **24% annually**

**Application**:
- If total ≤ 24%: Generally reasonable, confirm as calculated
- If total 24%-30%: May be acceptable depending on loan type, risk, term
- If total > 30%: Likely unreasonable, consider reducing to around 24%

**Exception**: If already confirmed by effective judgment, defer to judgment

### 9.3 Burden of Proof

**If Administrator Questions Reasonableness**:
- Creditor (financial institution) should justify rates
- Provide evidence of actual losses, costs, risk premiums
- If cannot justify: Administrator may reduce to reasonable level

---

## Part 10: Special Considerations for Different Financial Institution Types

### 10.1 Policy Banks vs. Commercial Banks

**Policy Banks** (政策性银行: e.g., China Development Bank, Export-Import Bank of China):
- May have preferential policy rates
- Often secured by government guarantees
- Interest rates typically lower

**Commercial Banks**: Market rates

### 10.2 Small Loan Companies and Pawn Shops

**Licensed but Non-Bank**:
- Subject to local regulations (may vary by province)
- Interest rates often higher than banks but should still comply with reasonableness standards
- Review license carefully; if unlicensed, treat as private lending

### 10.3 Finance Companies (企业财务公司)

**Affiliated Company Financing**: Parent company establishes finance company to provide loans to subsidiaries

**Review Points**:
- Verify finance company license
- Check if affiliated transactions comply with corporate governance
- Interest rates should be commercially reasonable

---

## Summary / 总结

Financial institution claims have **special regulatory treatment**:

**Key Distinctions from Private Lending**:
- Not subject to Private Lending Judicial Interpretation rate caps
- Can charge compound interest (on unpaid interest, per PBOC rules)
- Can charge penalty interest (1.3-1.8x loan rate, per PBOC rules)
- Subject to reasonableness standard (total ~24% guidance)

**Critical Review Points**:
1. **Verify financial institution status**: Require license/regulatory approval
2. **Review disguised interest**: Service fees, consulting fees may be disguised interest
3. **Check compound interest base**: Should be unpaid **interest only**, not principal
4. **Check penalty interest**: Overdue vs. misappropriation; cannot stack
5. **Calculate total burden**: Interest + compound + penalty + fees should not significantly exceed 24% annually
6. **NPL transfer**: Verify transfer agreement terms on post-transfer interest
7. **Floating rates**: Apply segmented calculation with historical LPR data

**Documentation**: All calculations must use universal_debt_calculator_cli.py and generate Excel/CSV showing process

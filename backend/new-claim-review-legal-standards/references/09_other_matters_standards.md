---

## Part 1: Statute of Limitations Rules

### 1.1 General Limitation Period

**Civil Code Article 188**: **3-year limitation** from date claimant knew or should have known of rights infringement

**Starting Date**: Date of default (e.g., payment deadline passed)

### 1.2 Suspension (中止)

**Civil Code Article 194**: Limitation period **suspended** in last 6 months if obstacle occurs

**Obstacles**:
- Force majeure (natural disaster, epidemic, war)
- Person without/limited capacity lacks legal representative
- Heir未确定 (before inheritance)

**Effect**: Resume counting after obstacle removed

### 1.3 Interruption (中断)

**Civil Code Article 195**: Limitation period **resets** (starts over from zero) upon:

**(1) Filing lawsuit or arbitration**
**(2) Creditor's demand for performance** (催告)
**(3) Debtor's acknowledgment of debt**

**Effect**: New 3-year period starts from interruption event

### 1.4 Maximum Period

**Civil Code Article 188 Paragraph 2**: **20-year absolute maximum** from rights infringement date (no suspension/interruption exceptions)

### 1.5 Review Application

**Statute of Limitations Risk Assessment**:

```
Step 1: Identify claim accrual date (debt due date)
Step 2: Identify review base date (审查基准日)
Step 3: Calculate years elapsed

Risk Classification:
├─ Within 3 years → Low risk (★☆☆)
├─ 3-5 years, with interruption evidence → Medium risk (★★☆)
├─ 5-10 years, or no interruption evidence → High risk (★★★)
└─ Beyond 20 years → Extremely high risk (litigation likely dismissed)

Step 4: Check for interruption events:
        □ Lawsuit/arbitration filed?
        □ Demand letters sent?
        □ Debtor acknowledgment (repayment, settlement talks)?

Step 5: Document in Risk Identification section
```

## Part 2: Burden of Proof Allocation

### 2.1 General Rule

**Civil Procedure Law Article 67**: "Who asserts, who proves" (谁主张，谁举证)

**Application**:
- Creditor bears burden to prove: (1) Contractual relationship, (2) Performance obligations, (3) Default occurred

### 2.2 Special Rules

**Civil Code Evidence Rules**:

**(1) Loan Relationships** (Supreme Court Private Lending Provisions Article 16):
- Lender proves: Loan contract exists
- Lender proves: Funds actually delivered (bank transfer records)
- If borrower claims repayment: **Borrower proves repayment**

**(2) Guarantee Relationships**:
- Creditor proves: Guarantee contract signed
- Creditor proves: Main debt matured and unpaid
- If guarantor claims expiration of guarantee period: **Guarantor proves**

**(3) Performance Records**:
- Party claiming performance: Bears burden to prove delivery/payment completed

### 2.3 Burden of Proof Risk Assessment

**In Claim Review Context**:

```
Evidence Evaluation with Burden Consideration:

If creditor has burden:
  ├─ High-strength evidence available → Low burden risk (★☆☆)
  ├─ Medium-strength evidence → Medium burden risk (★★☆)
  └─ Low-strength evidence or missing → High burden risk (★★★)

If debtor has burden (e.g., proving repayment):
  └─ Note: Creditor's burden risk is lower (favorable position)
```

## Part 3: Set-Off Rights (抵销权)

### 3.1 Legal Basis

**Civil Code Articles 568-570**: Mutual debts may be set off

### 3.2 Conditions for Valid Set-Off

**Requirements**:
1. **Mutual debts**: Party A owes Party B AND Party B owes Party A
2. **Same type** (both monetary debts)
3. **Both debts matured**
4. **Set-off not prohibited by law or contract**

### 3.3 Prohibited Set-Offs

**Civil Code Article 568**: Cannot set off if:
- Debt nature prohibits set-off (e.g., alimony, personal injury compensation)
- Contract explicitly prohibits set-off
- Would harm third-party rights

### 3.4 Set-Off Procedure

**Civil Code Article 569**: Set-off takes effect upon **notice** to other party (unilateral act)

**No Need for Agreement**: Party asserting set-off only needs to notify (not obtain consent)

### 3.5 Review Application

**When Debtor Claims Set-Off Right**:

```
Step 1: Verify mutual debts exist
        □ Evidence of claim A → B?
        □ Evidence of claim B → A?

Step 2: Check maturity
        □ Both debts matured before review base date?

Step 3: Check prohibitions
        □ Legal prohibition (nature of debt)?
        □ Contractual prohibition (agreement clause)?

Step 4: Calculate net debt after set-off
        Example: A owes B 100万, B owes A 40万 → Net: A owes B 60万

Step 5: Document in Claimable Range Analysis:
        - Conservative strategy: Ignore set-off (claim full 100万)
        - Balanced/Aggressive: Consider set-off (claim net 60万)
```

## Part 4: Jurisdiction Objections (管辖权异议)

### 4.1 Legal Basis

**Civil Procedure Law Article 127**: Defendant may file jurisdiction objection within **15 days of receipt of lawsuit**

### 4.2 Grounds for Jurisdiction

**Territorial Jurisdiction**:
- Defendant's domicile
- Contractual performance location
- Contractual agreement (parties may agree jurisdiction)

**Special Jurisdiction**:
- Contract disputes: Defendant domicile OR contract performance location
- Tort disputes: Tort occurrence location OR result location
- Real property: Property location (exclusive jurisdiction)

### 4.3 Strategic Considerations in Debt Review

**When Reviewing Litigation Risk**:

```
Jurisdiction Analysis:

If contract has jurisdiction clause:
  └─ Check validity (must be specific court, not vague)
  └─ Note: Reduces jurisdiction risk

If no jurisdiction clause:
  ├─ Identify defendant's domicile (usual jurisdiction)
  ├─ Identify contract performance location (alternative)
  └─ Assess litigation venue convenience

Risk to Litigation Strategy:
  - Favorable jurisdiction (local court, convenient) → Low risk (★☆☆)
  - Unfavorable jurisdiction (remote, defendant-friendly) → Medium/High risk (★★☆ or ★★★)
```

### 4.4 Exclusive Jurisdiction (Mandatory)

**Civil Procedure Law Article 34**:

**Real Property Disputes**: MUST be in property location court (no alternative)

**Application**: If claim involves mortgage, pledge, property ownership → Check property location for jurisdiction

---

## Part 5: Tax and Social Insurance Late Fees

### 5.1 Tax Late Fees (滞纳金)

**Tax Collection Law Article 32**: 0.05% daily late fee for unpaid taxes

**Civil Context**:
- Tax late fees are **administrative penalties** (not civil debt)
- In civil debt review: **Generally not included** as claimable amount
- Exception: If court judgment explicitly included → May claim per judgment

### 5.2 Social Insurance Late Fees

**Social Insurance Law Article 86**: Late fees for unpaid social insurance contributions

**Civil Context**:
- Similar to tax late fees: Administrative nature
- In civil debt review: **Generally not included**
- Exception: If government authority transferred to third party with late fee → May claim per agreement

### 5.3 Review Application

**When Reviewing Tax/Social Insurance Claims**:

```
□ Identify principal amount (tax/insurance contribution)
□ Identify late fee amount (滞纳金)

Classification:
  ├─ Principal: Civil debt (if private party advanced payment)
  └─ Late fee: Administrative penalty (generally NOT claimable in civil context)

Exception:
  If court judgment/government agreement explicitly included late fee → Claim per judgment/agreement

Document in Amount Breakdown:
  - Confirmed principal: ¥ [amount]
  - Late fee: ¥ [amount] (noted as "administrative penalty, typically not claimable in civil context")
```

## Part 6: Pending Litigation/Arbitration Claims

### 6.1 Declaration Allowed

**Principle**: Claims in pending litigation or arbitration may be declared provisionally

### 6.2 Review Treatment

**Suspension of Final Determination**:
- Reviewer **does not make final determination** of pending litigation/arbitration claims
- Reviewer **provisionally notes** the claim
- Wait for litigation/arbitration to conclude

**After Judgment/Award Effective**:
- Issue **final review opinion** per effective legal instrument
- Confirm amount per judgment/award

**If Litigation/Arbitration Dismissed or Claimant Loses**:
- Do not confirm claim

### 6.3 Risk Assessment

**Pending Litigation Claims**:

```
Risk Classification:
├─ Strong evidence + clear legal basis → Low risk (★☆☆) - likely to win
├─ Moderate evidence or legal uncertainty → Medium risk (★★☆)
└─ Weak evidence or adverse procedural status → High risk (★★★)

Document in Risk Identification:
  "This claim is currently in litigation (case number: [案号]). Final determination pending court judgment. Litigation risk: [★☆☆/★★☆/★★★]"
```

# Legal Standards Reference

## Purpose

This document provides comprehensive legal foundations for debt claim review in bankruptcy proceedings, including applicable laws, Supreme Court interpretations, and key legal principles.

## Part 1: Primary Legal Framework

### Enterprise Bankruptcy Law

**Full Title**: 《中华人民共和国企业破产法》

**Promulgation**: August 27, 2006, by the 23rd Session of the Standing Committee of the 10th National People's Congress

**Key Provisions for Debt Review**:

#### Article 44 - Debt Declaration Deadline
```
People's court shall determine a debt declaration deadline, with a minimum of 30 days and maximum of 3 months from the date of bankruptcy acceptance announcement.
```

#### Article 48 - Debt Verification
```
债权人应当在人民法院确定的债权申报期限内向管理人申报债权。
债务人所欠职工的工资和医疗、伤残补助、抚恤费用，所欠的应当划入职工个人账户的基本养老保险、基本医疗保险费用，以及法律、行政法规规定应当支付给职工的补偿金，不必申报，由管理人调查后列出清单并予以公示。职工对清单记载有异议的，可以要求管理人更正；管理人不予更正的，职工可以向人民法院提起诉讼。
```

**Translation**:
Creditors shall declare claims to the administrator within the deadline determined by the people's court.

Employee wages, medical expenses, disability subsidies, survivor benefits, basic pension and medical insurance that should be credited to employee individual accounts, and compensation required by law need not be declared; the administrator shall investigate, list, and publicize them. If employees object to the list, they may request corrections from the administrator; if the administrator refuses, employees may file a lawsuit with the people's court.

#### Article 113 - Repayment Priority Order
```
破产财产在优先清偿破产费用和共益债务后，依照下列顺序清偿：
（一）破产人所欠职工的工资和医疗、伤残补助、抚恤费用，所欠的应当划入职工个人账户的基本养老保险、基本医疗保险费用，以及法律、行政法规规定应当支付给职工的补偿金；
（二）破产人欠缴的除前项规定以外的社会保险费用和破产人所欠税款；
（三）普通破产债权。
```

**Repayment Priority**:
1. Bankruptcy costs and common benefit debts (先于清偿)
2. Employee wages, medical/disability/survivor benefits, pensions, medical insurance, statutory compensation
3. Social insurance (除前项) and taxes
4. Ordinary bankruptcy claims

**Key Implication**: Debt classification (priority vs. ordinary vs. subordinated) directly affects recovery prospects.

### Civil Code

**Full Title**: 《中华人民共和国民法典》

**Effective Date**: January 1, 2021

**Key Provisions**:

#### Article 188 - Statute of Limitations Period
```
向人民法院请求保护民事权利的诉讼时效期间为三年。法律另有规定的，依照其规定。
诉讼时效期间自权利人知道或者应当知道权利受到损害以及义务人之日起计算。法律另有规定的，依照其规定。但是，自权利受到损害之日起超过二十年的，人民法院不予保护，有特殊情况的，人民法院可以根据权利人的申请决定延长。
```

**Translation**:
The statute of limitations period for requesting civil rights protection from the people's court is **three years**. Where otherwise provided by law, such provisions shall apply.

The statute period commences from when the rights holder knows or should know that rights were infringed and who the obligor is. Where otherwise provided by law, such provisions shall apply. However, where more than 20 years have elapsed from the date of rights infringement, the people's court shall not protect them; under special circumstances, the people's court may decide to extend upon the rights holder's application.

**Critical Note**: Changed from **2 years** (in former General Principles of Civil Law) to **3 years** (in Civil Code, effective 2021-01-01).

#### Article 189 - Statute Suspension
```
当事人约定同一债务分期履行的，诉讼时效期间自最后一期履行期限届满之日起计算。
```

For installment debts, statute runs from the last installment's due date.

#### Article 195 - Statute Interruption Events
```
有下列情形之一的，诉讼时效中断，从中断、有关程序终结时起，诉讼时效期间重新计算：
（一）权利人向义务人提出履行请求；
（二）义务人同意履行义务；
（三）权利人提起诉讼或者申请仲裁；
（四）与提起诉讼或者申请仲裁具有同等效力的其他情形。
```

**Interruption Events**:
1. Rights holder demands performance from obligor
2. Obligor agrees to perform
3. Rights holder files lawsuit or arbitration
4. Other circumstances with equivalent effect

**Effect**: Statute restarts from interruption event.

#### Article 561 - Payment Offset Order
```
债务人在履行主债务外还应当支付利息和实现债权的有关费用，其给付不足以清偿全部债务的，除当事人另有约定外，应当按照下列顺序履行：
（一）实现债权的有关费用；
（二）利息；
（三）主债务。
```

**Offset Order for General Debts**:
1. Costs for realizing the claim
2. Interest
3. Principal debt

**Application**: When debtor makes partial payment, apply in this order unless parties agreed otherwise.

## Part 2: Supreme Court Interpretations

### On Private Lending Interest Rates

**Document**: 《最高人民法院关于审理民间借贷案件适用法律若干问题的规定》(2020 Revision)

**Key Provisions**:

#### Article 25 - Interest Rate Cap (2020 Revision)
```
出借人请求借款人按照合同约定利率支付利息的，人民法院应予支持，但是双方约定的利率超过合同成立时一年期贷款市场报价利率四倍的除外。
```

**Translation**:
When a lender requests the borrower to pay interest at the contracted rate, the people's court shall support it, **except when the agreed rate exceeds four times the one-year LPR at the time of contract formation**.

**Critical Rule**: Interest rate (including penalty interest) cap = **4× LPR**

**Calculation**:
- If 1-year LPR = 3.45%, then cap = 3.45% × 4 = 13.8%
- Amounts exceeding cap are NOT confirmed

**Application**:
- Check ALL penalty calculations against this cap
- If declared penalty > 4× LPR, use 4× LPR as confirmed amount
- Then apply 就低原则 (compare with declared amount)

### On Delayed Performance Interest

**Document**: 《最高人民法院关于执行程序中计算迟延履行期间的债务利息适用法律若干问题的解释》

#### Article 1 - Delayed Performance Interest Rate
```
根据民事诉讼法第二百五十三条规定加倍计算之后的迟延履行期间的债务利息，包括迟延履行期间的一般债务利息和加倍部分债务利息。
迟延履行期间的一般债务利息，根据生效法律文书确定的方法计算；生效法律文书未确定给付该利息的，不予计算。
加倍部分债务利息的计算方法为：加倍部分债务利息=债务人尚未清偿的生效法律文书确定的除一般债务利息之外的金钱债务×日万分之一点七五×迟延履行期间。
```

**Key Points**:
- **Fixed rate**: Daily rate of **0.0175%** (万分之1.75)
- **Applicable to**: Only judgment debts where performance deadline expired
- **Base**: Amount in delayed performance (may include principal + interest + costs per judgment)
- **Not affected by**: Contract terms (fixed statutory rate)

#### Article 2 - Performance Deadline Determination
```
加倍部分债务利息自生效法律文书确定的履行期间届满之日起计算。
```

**Performance Deadline**:
- If judgment specifies deadline: Use that date
- If judgment specifies period (e.g., "within 15 days"): Effective date + period
- If no deadline specified: Use effective date

**Effective Date Rules**:
- First-instance, no appeal: 15 days after delivery (service date + 15)
- Second-instance (including affirmation): **Second-instance judgment date** (NOT first-instance effective date)

#### Article 4 - Offset Order for Judgment Debts
```
被执行人的财产不足以清偿全部债务的，应当先清偿生效法律文书确定的金钱债务，再清偿加倍部分债务利息，但当事人对清偿顺序另有约定的除外。
```

**Offset Order for Judgment Debts**:
1. Amounts determined in legal document (judgment principal, interest, costs)
2. Delayed performance interest (加倍部分)

**Different from general debts** - see Civil Code Article 561 for comparison.

### On Execution Statute

**Document**: 《最高人民法院关于适用〈中华人民共和国民事诉讼法〉的解释》

#### Article 463 - Execution Statute Period
```
申请执行的期间为二年。申请执行时效的中止、中断，适用法律有关诉讼时效中止、中断的规定。
前款规定的期间，从法律文书规定履行期间的最后一日起计算；法律文书规定分期履行的，从规定的每次履行期间的最后一日起计算；法律文书未规定履行期间的，从法律文书生效之日起计算。
```

**Key Points**:
- **Period**: 2 years (NOT 3 years like general statute)
- **Start date**:
  * Specific deadline: From last day of performance period
  * Installment: Each installment has own 2-year period
  * No deadline specified: From effective date
- **Interruption/Suspension**: Same rules as general statute apply

## Part 3: Legal Principle Applications

### Principle: Statute of Limitations Transition Rule

**Background**: Civil Code changed statute period from 2 years → 3 years, effective October 1, 2017.

**Transition Rule**:

#### Step 1: Calculate "Old Law Expiration Date"
```
Old Law Expiration = Statute Start Date + 2 years
```

#### Step 2: Apply Transition Rule
```
IF Old Law Expiration < October 1, 2017:
    Apply 2-year period
ELSE:
    Apply 3-year period (from original start date)
```

**Examples**:

**Example 1** (2-year applies):
```
Start: June 1, 2015
Old Law Expiration: June 1, 2015 + 2 years = June 1, 2017
June 1, 2017 < October 1, 2017 → Apply 2-year period
Final expiration: June 1, 2017
```

**Example 2** (3-year applies):
```
Start: January 1, 2016
Old Law Expiration: January 1, 2016 + 2 years = January 1, 2018
January 1, 2018 ≥ October 1, 2017 → Apply 3-year period
Final expiration: January 1, 2016 + 3 years = January 1, 2019
```

**Example 3** (3-year, recent claim):
```
Start: March 15, 2022
Old Law Expiration: March 15, 2024 (clearly after Oct 1, 2017)
→ Apply 3-year period
Final expiration: March 15, 2025
```

### Principle: Evidence Hierarchy in Legal Systems

**Hierarchy** (highest to lowest):

1. **Effective Legal Documents**:
   - Final judgments, mediations, arbitrations
   - **Effect**: Conclusive, supersede all prior evidence
   - **Res judicata**: Cannot re-litigate determined facts

2. **Bilateral Written Confirmations**:
   - Settlement agreements (both parties signed)
   - Reconciliation statements (debtor signature/seal)
   - Debt confirmation letters (bilateral)
   - **Effect**: Supersede prior performance evidence

3. **Contracts and Formal Agreements**:
   - Main contracts
   - Supplementary agreements
   - Amendments (later supersedes earlier)
   - **Effect**: Define rights and obligations

4. **Unilateral Performance Evidence**:
   - Invoices (from creditor)
   - Delivery slips (from creditor/carrier)
   - Payment records (from debtor)
   - **Effect**: Support contracts, weaker probative value alone

**Application**:
- When conflict: Use higher-hierarchy evidence
- When confirming amounts: Prioritize legal documents/confirmations over original contracts
- When analyzing relationships: Trace from highest to lowest to understand complete picture

### Principle: Subordinated Debt under Bankruptcy Law

**Legal Basis**: Enterprise Bankruptcy Law Article 113 (普通破产债权)

**Subordinated Debts**:

1. **Delayed Performance Interest (加倍部分债务利息)**:
   - Legal reasoning: Interest on debt, penalty nature
   - Should not reduce ordinary creditors' recovery
   - Repaid only after ordinary claims satisfied

2. **Shareholder/Related Party Claims** (in some cases):
   - To prevent shareholder self-dealing
   - May be subordinated by court determination

**Critical Identification**:
- ❌ **WRONG**: Classifying delayed performance interest as ordinary debt
- ✅ **RIGHT**: Classifying delayed performance interest as subordinated debt (劣后债权)

**Reporting**: Must separate ordinary and subordinated amounts in review opinion form.

### Principle: Employee Priority Debt

**Legal Basis**: Enterprise Bankruptcy Law Article 113(1)

**Priority Debts**:
- Employee wages
- Medical, disability, survivor benefits
- Basic pension and medical insurance (个人账户)
- Statutory employee compensation

**From Tax Authority Claims**:
- **Individual income tax** (个人所得税) = Employee priority debt
- **Individual social insurance** (个人社会保险费) = Employee priority debt
- **Corporate taxes** = Ordinary debt

**Verification Standards**:
- **Core materials required**: Labor contract, arbitration document, OR judgment
- **Without core materials**: Mark【暂缓确认】, pending company confirmation
- **After confirmation**: If employee → priority; if labor service → ordinary

## Part 4: Key Legal Concepts

### Acceleration Clauses (加速到期条款)

**Definition**: Contract clauses allowing creditor to demand immediate full payment upon certain breach events.

**Common Triggers**:
- Failure to pay one installment
- Bankruptcy filing
- Material breach

**Effect on Statute**:
- If acceleration triggered: Statute starts from acceleration date (earlier than normal)
- Must search contracts for keywords: "加速到期", "提前到期", "立即到期"

**Application**: Review all contracts for acceleration clauses before determining statute start date.

### Force Majeure and Statute Suspension

**Legal Basis**: Civil Code provisions on statute suspension

**Applicable Conditions**:
- Occurs in **last 6 months** of statute period
- Force majeure or other obstacles prevent claim
- Objectively impossible to exercise rights

**Common Events**:
- Natural disasters
- Pandemic lockdowns (e.g., COVID-19)
- War, civil unrest
- Rights holder lacks capacity with no legal representative

**Calculation**:
```
Original Expiration: Date X
Suspension Event Starts: Within last 6 months before X
Suspension Event Ends: Date Y
New Expiration: Date Y + 6 months
```

**Application**: Particularly relevant for 2020-2022 claims (COVID pandemic).

### Interest on Interest (Compound Interest)

**Legal Standard**: Requires **explicit contractual basis**

**When Allowed**:
- Contract explicitly provides for compound interest
- Specifies compounding cycle (monthly, quarterly, annually)

**When NOT Allowed**:
- Default rule: Simple interest only
- Cannot infer compound interest from general interest clause

**Calculation**: Use `universal_debt_calculator_cli.py compound` mode with specified cycle.

## Part 5: Legal Limits and Caps

### Interest Rate Caps

**Primary Cap**: 4× LPR (for private lending)

**Application**:
- Contract interest: If > 4× LPR, cap at 4× LPR
- Penalty interest: If > 4× LPR, cap at 4× LPR
- Combined interest + penalty: Cannot exceed 4× LPR total

**Which LPR to Use**:
- 1-year LPR for debts ≤ 5 years
- 5-year+ LPR for debts > 5 years (see period matching principle)

**Example Calculation**:
```
1-year LPR = 3.45%
Cap = 3.45% × 4 = 13.8% annual

Debt period: 365 days
Principal: 100,000
Max interest: 100,000 × 13.8% × (365/365) = 13,800元
```

### Maximum Statute Period

**Maximum Absolute Period**: 20 years from date of rights infringement

**Legal Basis**: Civil Code Article 188

**Application**:
- Even with interruptions, cannot exceed 20 years from injury date
- Rare in bankruptcy cases (most debts < 20 years old)

### Court Fee Limits

**Standard**: According to court fee regulations

**Special Rule**: Generally do NOT calculate delayed performance interest on court fees

**Rationale**:
- Court fees have separate performance deadlines
- Need individual assessment
- Be cautious even if deadline expired

## Part 6: Applicable Law Selection

### Contract Formation Date Rule

**Principle**: Laws in effect at contract formation generally apply

**Exception**: Procedural laws (like new statute periods) may apply retroactively per transition rules

**Example**:
- Contract formed: 2015
- Interest rate dispute: 2025
- **Apply**: 2020 Supreme Court interpretation on interest caps (procedural application)
- **But**: Contract terms from 2015 still govern unless invalid

### Lex Posterior (Later Law Prevails)

**Principle**: When laws conflict, later law prevails

**Example**:
- General Principles of Civil Law (1987): 2-year statute
- Civil Code (2021): 3-year statute
- **Apply**: Civil Code (later law), subject to transition rules

## Part 7: Quick Reference Tables

### Statute of Limitations

| Debt Type | Period | Start Date |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Contract debt | 2y or 3y* | Day after deadline |
| Tort debt | 2y or 3y* | When knew/should know |
| Judgment debt (execution) | 2 years | Day after performance deadline |

*Use transition rule to determine 2y vs 3y

### Debt Priority Classification

| Category | Repayment Order | Examples |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| 破产费用/共益债务 | Before all others | Administration costs, common benefit |
| 优先债权 | First | Employee wages, individual tax/insurance |
| 普通债权 | Second | Unsecured contract debts, principal, interest |
| 劣后债权 | Last | Delayed performance interest (加倍部分) |

### Interest Rate Reference (2024-2025)

| Type | Rate | Application |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1-year LPR | 3.45% | ≤5 year debts, general commercial debts |
| 5-year+ LPR | 3.95% | >5 year debts, long-term loans |
| Legal Cap | LPR × 4 | Maximum for private lending |
| Delayed Performance | 0.0175% daily | Fixed, judgment debts only |

## Summary

**Key Legal Foundations**:
1. **Enterprise Bankruptcy Law**: Priority order, debt verification process
2. **Civil Code**: 3-year statute (with 2-year transition), offset order, interruption rules
3. **Supreme Court Interpretations**: 4× LPR cap, delayed performance interest (0.0175% daily)
4. **Execution Statute**: 2-year period for judgment debts

**Critical Legal Principles**:
- Statute transition rule (2y vs 3y determination)

- Subordinated debt classification (delayed performance interest)
- Interest rate caps (4× LPR maximum)

**Application in Debt Review**:
- Every determination must have legal basis
- Apply correct statute period via transition rule
- Classify debts correctly (priority/ordinary/subordinated)
- Cap penalties at 4× LPR
- Use evidence hierarchy to resolve conflicts

# 职工债权审查标准

## Purpose

## Part 1: Definition and Scope / 职工债权范围

### 1.1 Legal Basis

**Bankruptcy Law Article 48 Paragraph 2**: Employee claims need not be declared; administrator investigates and lists them

**Bankruptcy Law Article 113 Priority Order**:
1. Bankruptcy costs + Common benefit debts
2. **Employee claims** (第一顺位)
3. Social insurance and taxes (excluding employee portion)
4. Ordinary bankruptcy claims

### 1.2 Scope of Employee Claims

**Bankruptcy Law Article 113 First Priority Items**:

**(1) Wages and Salaries (工资)**:
- Regular wages, bonuses, allowances
- Unpaid wages for work performed

**(2) Medical, Disability, and Survivor Benefits**:
- Medical expenses (医疗费用)
- Disability subsidies (伤残补助)
- Survivor benefits (抚恤费用)

**(3) Basic Pension and Medical Insurance**:
- Amounts that **should be credited to employee individual accounts**
- 应当划入职工个人账户的基本养老保险
- 应当划入职工个人账户的基本医疗保险

- Economic compensation per Labor Contract Law
- 法律、行政法规规定应当支付给职工的补偿金
- Examples: Severance pay, termination compensation

### 1.3 Items NOT in Employee Priority

**Excluded from First Priority** (may be lower priority or ordinary claims):

## Part 2: Administrator's Proactive Investigation Duty / 管理人主动调查

### 2.1 No Declaration Required

**Key Difference from Other Claims**: Employees do **not need to declare** claims

**Administrator's Duty**:
1. **Investigate** amounts owed to employees
2. **Compile list** of employee claims
3. **Publicize list** for employee review

**Legal Basis**: Bankruptcy Law Article 48(2)

### 2.2 Investigation Methods

**Sources**:
- HR department records
- Payroll records
- Employment contracts
- Social insurance payment records
- Financial accounting records

**Administrator Actions**:
- Request HR to provide employee roster and wage data
- Review payroll bank transfer records
- Verify social insurance individual account contributions
- Calculate severance pay per Labor Contract Law

### 2.3 Employee Objections

**If Employee Objects to List**:
1. Employee may request administrator to correct
2. If administrator refuses correction: Employee may sue in court

**Timeline**: Typically during creditors meeting review period

## Part 3: Third-Party Advance Payment of Employee Claims / 第三方垫付职工债权

### 3.1 Common Scenarios

**Government or Third Party Advances Wages**:
- Local government pays employees on behalf of bankrupt employer
- Other entity (e.g., parent company, social fund) advances wages
- Wage Guarantee Fund (欠薪保障基金) pays employees

**Question**: What priority does the third party (advancer) have for reimbursement?

### 3.2 Legal Framework

**Supreme Court Bankruptcy Minutes Article 27**:

**(1) General Third-Party Advance**:
- Third party steps into position of employees
- **Reimbursement claim has SAME priority as underlying employee claim** (First Priority per Article 113(1))

**(2) Wage Guarantee Fund Advance**:
- Special government-backed fund for unpaid wages
- **Priority**: **Second priority** per Article 113(2) (same as social insurance and taxes)

**Rationale**: Distinguish general third-party assistance (retains employee priority) from specialized government fund (treated as government obligation, second priority)

### 3.3 Administrator Review

**When Third Party Claims Reimbursement**:

```
Step 1: Verify third party actually paid employees
        - Payment records
        - Employee receipts/confirmations

Step 2: Verify amounts match employee claims
        - Cross-check with employee wage records

Step 3: Determine third party's identity:
        ├─ Wage Guarantee Fund? → Second priority (Article 113(2))
        └─ Other entity? → First priority (Article 113(1), employee priority)

Step 4: Confirm reimbursement claim accordingly
```

**Important**: Third party **replaces** employees; employees should not also claim (avoid double payment)

## Part 4: Calculation of Severance Pay / 经济补偿金计算

### 4.1 Legal Basis

**Labor Contract Law Articles 46-47**: Severance pay calculation

### 4.2 Calculation Formula

```
Severance Pay = Monthly Wage × Years of Service
```

**Years of Service**:
- 6 months or more → Round up to 1 year
- Less than 6 months → 0.5 year

**Monthly Wage**: Average monthly wage in 12 months before termination

**Caps**:
- If monthly wage > 3× local average wage: Capped at 3× local average
- Years counted: Maximum 12 years (for capped wages)

### 4.3 In Bankruptcy Context

**Termination Date**: Typically bankruptcy filing date (employment ends)

**Administrator Calculation**:
- Determine each employee's years of service (from hire date to bankruptcy filing)
- Calculate average monthly wage (12 months prior)
- Apply formula
- Check caps

## Part 5: Special Considerations / 特殊情形

### 5.1 Employees with Ownership Interest

**Question**: Do shareholder-employees have same priority?

**General Rule**: Yes, even if employee is also shareholder

**Exception**: If "wage" is actually dividend disguised as wage → May be treated as subordinated shareholder claim

**Review**: Check if wage amount is reasonable relative to duties and market rates

### 5.2 Senior Executives

**Question**: Do executives (董事、监事、高级管理人员) have same priority?

**Rule**: Yes, but subject to fairness review

**Administrator Duty**: Verify executive wages are reasonable (not excessive)

### 5.3 Post-Bankruptcy Employment

**Question**: Employees working during bankruptcy procedure - are their wages employee claims?

**Rule**: **No**, post-bankruptcy wages are **common benefit debts** (共益债务), paid before all bankruptcy claims

**Classification**:
- Pre-bankruptcy wages: Employee claims (Article 113(1))
- Post-bankruptcy wages: Common benefit debts (Article 42)

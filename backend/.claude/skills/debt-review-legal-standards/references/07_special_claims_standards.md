# Special Claim Types Review Standards
# 特殊债权类型审查标准

## Purpose

Review standards for specialized claim types: financing leases, factoring, and construction project claims, each with unique legal frameworks and priority rules.

## Part 1: Financial Leasing Claims / 融资租赁债权

### 1.1 Definition and Legal Framework

**Financing Lease (融资租赁)**: Lessor purchases assets per lessee's specifications, leases to lessee; lessee gains use, lessor retains ownership until final payment.

**Legal Basis**:
- Civil Code Chapter 15 (Financing Lease Contract)
- Supreme Court Financing Lease Interpretation (2020)

### 1.2 Validity - Fictitious Leased Property

**Civil Code Article 737**: Contract invalid if parties **fabricate leased property**

**Administrator Review**:
- Verify leased property actually exists
- Check purchase invoices, delivery records, acceptance documents
- If property fictitious → Contract invalid; treat as loan (apply lending rules and caps)

### 1.3 Lessee Default - Lessor's Remedies

**Typical Default**: Lessee fails to pay rent

**Lessor May**:

**(1) Request All Remaining Rent** + Foreclose on Leased Property:
- Supreme Court Interpretation: Lessor may request lessee pay all unpaid rent + recover property
- Property sold; proceeds applied to debt

**(2) Request Property Foreclosure Only** (per procedure similar to secured claim realization):
- Lessor foregoes rent claim
- Focuses on recovering and selling property

**In Bankruptcy**:
- If lessor elects (1): Lessor has secured claim (secured by leased property) for unpaid rent
- Leased property value determines secured portion
- Excess rent: ordinary claim

### 1.4 Property Value Determination

**If Lessor and Lessee Dispute Property Value**:

**Methods** (in order of preference):
1. **Contract agreed value** (if specified for default scenario)
2. **Calculated value**: Per contract's depreciation schedule and remaining term
3. **Appraisal**: Court-appointed or mutually agreed appraiser

**Administrator Role**: If in bankruptcy and value disputed, may commission appraisal

### 1.5 Return of Excess Value

**Rule**: If property value > outstanding debt:
- Lessor must return excess to lessee (or estate)
- Example: Debt 500,000; property worth 800,000 → Return 300,000

**In Bankruptcy**: Excess returned to estate, benefits all creditors

### 1.6 Special Case: Sale-and-Leaseback (售后回租)

**Scenario**: Lessee first sells property to lessor, then leases it back

**Legal Treatment**: Valid if genuine transaction; review for substance

**Risk**: If property never actually transferred (fake sale) → May be disguised loan

## Part 2: Factoring Claims / 保理债权

### 2.1 Definition

**Factoring (保理)**: Creditor (supplier) transfers accounts receivable to factor (factoring company); factor provides financing

**Parties**:
- **Creditor/Supplier (债权人)**: Original holder of receivables
- **Debtor/Account Debtor (债务人)**: Obligor on receivables
- **Factor (保理商)**: Buys receivables, provides financing

### 2.2 Three Factoring Scenarios in Bankruptcy Context

#### Scenario A: Debtor is the Supplier (Factored Receivables)

**Situation**: Bankruptcy debtor is supplier who factored its receivables

**Effect**: Receivables transferred to factor; no longer debtor's asset

**Administrator Review**:
- Verify factoring contract and receivables transfer
- Typically no claim against estate (debtor already received financing)

#### Scenario B: Debtor is the Account Debtor

**Situation**: Bankruptcy debtor owes money on receivables that were factored

**Factoring Company Claims**: Factor (assignee of receivables) declares claim

**Administrator Review**:
1. **Verify underlying trade relationship** (original goods/services transaction)
2. **Verify factoring transfer validity** (contract, notice to account debtor)
3. **Confirm account debtor's obligation** per original transaction
4. **Critical**: Strict review; if only contract + invoice without delivery proof → May not confirm

**Why Strict**: Factoring fraud risk (fictitious receivables)

#### Scenario C: Debtor is Recourse Guarantor

**Situation**: Supplier factored receivables; debtor (bankruptcy entity) provided recourse guarantee (if account debtor doesn't pay, guarantor pays)

**Administrator Review**:
- Treat as guarantee claim (see `06_secured_claims_standards.md`)
- Verify guarantee contract
- Check if guarantor (debtor) already paid factor
- If paid: Factor should not also declare
- If not paid: Future reimbursement claim (conditional)

### 2.3 Fictitious Receivables

**Major Risk**: Supplier and account debtor collude to create fake receivables, defraud factor

**Red Flags**:
- No underlying transaction evidence (contracts, delivery notes, acceptance)
- Unusually large receivables without proportionate business history
- Related parties (supplier and account debtor affiliated)

**Administrator Duty**:
- Demand proof of underlying transactions
- If insufficient proof → Do not confirm claim

## Part 3: Construction Project Claims / 建设工程债权

### 3.1 Construction Priority Right (建设工程价款优先受偿权)

**Legal Basis**:
- Civil Code Article 807
- Supreme Court Construction Contract Interpretation (I) Article 41

**Rule**: Contractors have **priority right** over project owner's property (constructed building/structure) for unpaid project costs

### 3.2 Priority Right Exercise Period

**Critical Time Limit**: **18 months** from date when project payment should have been made

**Nature**: **Exclusion period** (除斥期间):
- Cannot be tolled, suspended, or interrupted
- If expired: Priority right extinguished (but ordinary claim remains)

**Commencement**: "Date when project payment should have been made"

**Determination**:
1. **If contract specifies payment date**: From that date
2. **If project delivered**: From delivery date
3. **If project not delivered but settlement completed**: From settlement date
4. **If neither**: From date contractor submits settlement documents

### 3.3 Priority Right Scope

**Covers**:
- Construction costs actually incurred
- Reasonable profit
- **Does NOT cover**: Interest (per some judicial opinions), damages beyond actual project value

**Review**: Check if claimed amount exceeds actual project value delivered

### 3.4 Priority vs. Mortgage

**Rule**: Construction priority right > Mortgage right (even if mortgage registered earlier)

**Exception**: If mortgage registered **before** construction started, depends on jurisdiction

**In Bankruptcy**:
- First: Construction project priority claims
- Second: Mortgage claims
- Third: Ordinary claims

### 3.5 Decoration/Fit-Out Projects (装修装饰工程)

**Question**: Does fit-out contractor have same priority right as construction contractor?

**Supreme Court Reply on Decoration Priority**: Decoration projects **may** have priority **if**:
1. **Building owner is the project issuer** (not tenant), OR building owner later ratified
2. **Contractor is qualified enterprise** (not individual)
3. **Priority limited to value added** to building by decoration

**In Practice**: Often disputed; requires careful review of:
- Owner vs. tenant identity
- Contractor qualifications
- Actual value added (may need appraisal)

### 3.6 Interest on Construction Debt

**Supreme Court Construction Interpretation (I) Article 26**: Interest calculation per agreement; if no agreement, per prevailing lending rate (LPR)

**Article 27**: Interest starts from:
1. **If project delivered**: Delivery date
2. **If not delivered, but settlement submitted**: Settlement submission date
3. **If neither**: Litigation filing date

**In Bankruptcy**: Calculate interest to day before bankruptcy filing

### 3.7 Quality Retention Money (质保金)

**Definition**: Portion of project payment withheld for warranty period

**Maturity in Bankruptcy**:

**General Rule**: Quality retention becomes due at end of warranty period

**In Bankruptcy** (per some precedents):
- **Un-matured retention**: Deemed matured at bankruptcy filing (Bankruptcy Law Article 46 - unmatured claims deemed matured)
- **Administrator Review**:
  - Check contract warranty period
  - If warranty period not yet expired: Claim still confirmable (deemed matured)
  - If project has quality issues: May reduce retention amount proportionally

**Debt Classification**:
- If retention for construction project: May have priority right (if within 18-month period)
- Otherwise: Ordinary claim

## Part 4: Review Checklists

### Financing Lease Claims

```
□ Verified leased property exists (not fictitious)?
□ Reviewed lease contract terms and rent schedule?
□ Determined lessor's election (rent + foreclosure vs. foreclosure only)?
□ Property value determined (agreement/depreciation/appraisal)?
□ Classified secured (up to property value) vs. ordinary portion?
□ If sale-leaseback: Verified genuine transfer occurred?
```

### Factoring Claims

```
□ Identified debtor's role (supplier/account debtor/guarantor)?
□ Verified underlying trade transaction exists?
□ Confirmed factoring transfer validity and notice?
□ Reviewed evidence strictness (contracts + delivery, not just invoices)?
□ Checked for fictitious receivables red flags?
□ If guarantor: Applied guarantee rules?
```

### Construction Claims

```
□ Verified actual construction work performed?
□ Determined payment due date (contract/delivery/settlement/submission)?
□ Calculated 18-month priority period: Expired or still valid?
□ Reviewed priority scope (costs, profit; not excessive)?
□ Determined if decoration project qualifies for priority (owner/qualified contractor/value-added)?
□ Calculated interest per Article 27 start date rules?
□ Reviewed quality retention: Maturity, amount, classification?
□ Classified: Priority (within 18 months) vs. Ordinary?
```

## Summary / 总结

Special claim types require specialized legal knowledge:

**Financing Leases**:
- Verify property not fictitious
- Lessor has secured claim up to leased property value
- Property value determination: contract → depreciation → appraisal
- Excess value returns to estate

**Factoring**:
- Strict review for fictitious receivables risk
- Verify underlying trade transactions
- Three scenarios depending on debtor's role
- Debtor as account debtor: Demand full transaction proof

**Construction**:
- **Priority right**: **18-month exclusion period** from payment due date
- Priority > mortgage (general rule)
- Decoration projects: Conditional priority (owner/qualified contractor/value-added)
- Quality retention: Deemed matured in bankruptcy
- Interest: Per agreement or LPR, starts per Article 27 rules

**Common Pitfalls**:
- ❌ Confirming factoring claims without verifying underlying transactions
- ❌ Missing 18-month construction priority period expiration
- ❌ Allowing decoration priority without meeting all three conditions
- ❌ Confirming fictitious lease property claims
